# Project 2 | Lessons Learned



### Initial Planning
1. Start w/ identifying high level User Stories (features)
    - This is an alternate to using the WBS
    - Stories can be built with your stakeholders and / or project team 
1. Gantt Chart - Can still help you w/ as a high level scheduling tool for when to develop features
    - Place user stories / features as individual items in chart
    - Place items in a targeted sprint
    - Keep in mind dependencies and if certain features are dependent on others
