# Project 1 | 2023-10-26

Bike Finder Planning meeting that seemed to go off the rails. Why? It was a topic of how to approach tickets in the backlog. Disagreement between myself and a co-worker.

<br>

What didn't work:

1. I could do a better job at recognizing when the conversation isn't going anywhere. I gave my opinion on an approach mulitple times and it was unproductive.

1. Repeating the same logic / reasoning and the conversation wasn't going anywhere

1. Frustration was experienced when my opinion wasn't being honored

<br>

Next time:

1. Give your opinion w/ logic and reasoning

1. Recognize if progress isn't being made on decision making

1. Your position is to guide the process but also support the team consensus

1. Remember that it's not about you or getting your way. This is human nature.

<br>

Challenge:

1. I believe that my job is to guide the project process and if the team's decision (or one individual) is to do something the opposite, how do I handle that?
