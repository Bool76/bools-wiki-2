**Next time:**  
*When evaluating backlog priority order and Sprint Planning - Always consider the MVP* 

Someone on our team brought this up as we were Sprint planning. It's not like I totally had lost focus on that important question, but as we were getting closer to wanting to launch and had about a month left of dev time, it was such a good reminder as to what tickets really needed to be worked on.

Consider the questions:  
1. What are the minimal features? 
1. What are the minimal features where someone can do the required user journeys?
1. Are the tickets reflecting the work in the right order?
