# Project 1 | 2023-11-06

Last week what worked:
1. A___ and I worked well together. I would say that in part because he allowed for some give and take
1. I tried to stay more mindful of playing the role of:
    - Support
    - Giving options
    - Providing a path or a framework but still w/ giving options
1. Recognizing when to speak and exercising more listening
1. Presenting a topic and then tossing it out to the group to initiate conversation

This week:

1. Keep working on presenting topics framework and then passing it to the group
1. Keep listening as a priority and being mindful when you're talking
1. Keep giving options or presenting topics with options
