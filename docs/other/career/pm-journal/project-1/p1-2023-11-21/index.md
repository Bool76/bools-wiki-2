# Project 1 | 2023-11-21

<br>

Observation:

1. There was a topic that came up again that completely pissed me off. People on the team don't seem to be listening. 

<br>

What worked:

1. Recognizing when you are really starting to get pissed off. This seemed to happen: 
    - A topic repeatedly came up that where from my perspective people weren't listening
    - I had the urge to get off mute and continue talking about it from my perspective since it seemed to me that again people weren't listening
    - I'm sure that I said my bit about the topic but the conversation continued which seemed to bypass my comment
    - I recognized I was seriously getting pissed. I recognized this and then realized I didn't need to say anything more. 
    - I kept on mute and distracted myself with other work

Next time:

1. Keep aware when you're getting irritated and how you might want to say the same things but it's just not working. So back away from the conversation.

1. Consider how you present information or a message that doesn't seem to be getting across. You might have to re-evalute your approach entirely. Ask yourself how can you do better or do it different?
