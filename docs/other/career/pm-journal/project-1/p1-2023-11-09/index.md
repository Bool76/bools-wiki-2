# Project 1 | 2023-11-09

Overview - This is more of a mid week review just cause I had thoughts I wanted to share

<br>

What worked:

1. Going from the list of Milestones to then creating a Gantt Chart helped to organize when to do certain bodies of work and also helped structure later meetings. Asking questions like:
    - What should go into the next Sprint? 
    - What order should they be in? 
    - Are there tickets created for the work we've identified?

<br>

Next time:

1. When starting a project w/ a team - Describe how there might be more planning meetings but it's necessary to create a foundation

1. Regarding A___ or someone else you don't get along with, do a thought exercise about what they do well and might how to utilize that
