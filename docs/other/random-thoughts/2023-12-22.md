>"The person from which you wanted the love, obviously doesn't exist, or you would've gained it. So in some ways you've taken a person that does exist and you've superimposed on them the person you wish existed... you're not functioning in reality, that you don't meet people where they are. That you need something from someone that they are incapable of giving."

Something to reflect on here. It's quite possible that the S__ that I thought existed was just this projection of a person that I wish existed. A person that fit all my needs and that filled the gaps in my heart and soul. If that version of her that I have in my head never existed then those thoughts and feelings for this person doesn't live in reality.

What do I think of that? 

There have been harsh lessons I've learned about how I've lived my life which have had some cause and affects. 

CAUSE - Lack of effort in my studies  
EFFECT - Had to figure out how I learn and go through the painful exercise of trying to learn

CAUSE - My development skills were shallow and underdeveloped  
EFFECT - I was in fear of losing my ob and had to figure out how to become valuable

It's possible this idea of superimposing a personality, love, feelings, on S__ that it's had a negative impact on my present day personality. I struggle with being close to people. I enjoy being by myself and living in my head. Maybe I don't get what I could out of my relationship to Deb. I should think more about this. 

I'd say that I protect my feelings to S__. I own them and no one can take that away. But have I created a false narrative where it's kept me from something?


I think that one of the best ways to summarize what she has meant to me was that she exercised a love to me that made me feel completely special. There was a gap in the love that my parents gave. I lived in such fear of them and S__ opened up a totally different world to me and one aspect of that was love and seemingly genuine interest in me.
