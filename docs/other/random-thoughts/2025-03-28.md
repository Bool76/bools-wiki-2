# 2025-03-28 | Off the drugs

I joke of course but I did quite adderall completely. Don't know if I posted this before but I went for a quick biometric screening for work where my bp
was taken and it was very high 141/60 or something close to that. Pissed me off. Really it did. No way it should be that hight. So I just stopped taking
adderall and didn't even get the newest refill. 

Observations:
1. I can take a deep breath and feel calm
1. There are times where I feel more present
1. I feel less anxious


At this time I want to get back to work. But I should write more about this later. Think about how coming off it is affecting my work. Pros and Cons. Also
what is it doing with my relationship? Things to think about.

### Other Thoughts

Since I was anxious anyway about work, what was the risk of coming off of it? Always seemed I was stressed with work where I thought adderall is / was helping with that. 

I'm always anxious and I can never settle down. Stopping it seems like that's helped.
