This level of misery can feel like I can't overcome it. This feels has seemingly never gone away. When I was in grade school I would find dread and imbalance in my inability to do well in school, prepare for a test, feel out of control when I received bad grades. 

SWY seemed to be the first instance where I had someone in my corner. You could say it was love. It was more than that. She was the bright north star, she flipped the light switch to show me a world of color. I've never doubted that's a huge part of how I've never been able to extinguish that connection. 

So what's different now? I've often said that because I have such little responsibilities (no kids) that I have no excuse to not accomplish something I deem meaningful. I think it's that ininnate responsibility that I feel an emmense amount of pressure. Everyday. Whether I know I'm failing at work, at home, in my music, in my level of fitness. 

How do I get beyond that? This is THE question and it's an answer I continue to fail at reaching. 

I am sick of being miserable. 

I guess that's it for now. I am going to continue trying to use this new method of visualization. "I'm a Machine". There's something to polluting my energy and also knowing have an internal navigation / direction that if I ignore it adds to my massive negativity.
