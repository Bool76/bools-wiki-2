Can I be honest? I might benefit from jounraling when all I want to do is be distracted. This could at least give an avenue for my thoughts. 

I have always needed an outlet for my feelings and thoughts. Today I wanted to just reach out to SWY so I could share feelings and thoughts
I had about music and work and being distracted and having a different perspective based on my time here on Earth. I think there's a way
to do that just by typing here. 

I was reflecting on what I think about relationships in relation to my life and what so far has been lived. Mostly I've identified that most
people will have no lasting interaction with your life. Of course I'm disappointed in that fact. It sounds depressing. You can't rely on most
people. This is why I have thought more and more about getting into the basis and practice of Stoicism. 


## Emotional Masterbation

I have found great joy and comfort in thinking about the past. But it's also hobbled me. I've always thought that I'm unqiue in that with 
signifcant past relationships they still mean something to me. That has never gone away. This has also devistated me. 

SIDE NOTE: Starting to feel like I don't want to work on the thing I'm working on. Why? Cause it's hard? Cause everything else is more fun? I would say
all of those things. 

I don't find issue with finding a lot of comfort in past events or people. I struggle with finding peace.
