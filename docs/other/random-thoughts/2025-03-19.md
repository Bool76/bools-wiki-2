# High Blood Pressure + Changes Needed

So my blood pressure was 140 / 60. That's high and that pisses me off. With how much I workout and watch what I eat.

I've always been an intense person for as long as I can recall; especially into my working years after college. It could be that ever since I've been on adderall that my stress has increased. This med was supposed to help me get work done. Solve that problem that I just have issues with focusing. Yet it COULD be an issue for my high blood pressure.

So what can I change? There's enough that always pisses me off. Can I avoid those? I'm sure I can't. The only proactive items I can think of is:

1. Come off of adderall
1. Start meditating

It's one more thing for me to try to find time to do. Great. But I've been more convinced that a certain state of mind could get me in a better place for music and even other things that I always seem to struggle with. I could try to do it at least once a week and then go from there.

I guess I just need to get back to work. Which is always where I fucking am. I'll get back to adding to the Project Jewel table and try once again to change my head space.
