# 2025-02-14 | Your a Car w/ an Engine and Your Fuel



Overview - You're a car

Overall Goal - To feel good (and not from a primative source)


## Navigation System

Two parts:
1. You have an internal navigation system that tells you where you should be going. This isn't something you need to work on. It's passive and it's loud. 

1. Where you place your focus / direction is either following your navigation system or not (do or do not)

## Fuel

### Random Thoughts

- Depending on your direction there is a specific fuel source that's needed

#### Example 
Navigation System Direction: Working on SRAM stuff
Fuel: (tbd) But it's at least specific to work  

New Direction: Talking to Sean
    - Against Navigation System
Fuel: Something different than NS Fuel

Result: 
    1. Changing direction to something Non-NS == BAD
    1. Mixing fuel types == BAD
