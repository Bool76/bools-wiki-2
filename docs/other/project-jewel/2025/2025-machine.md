### Breakdown

Not a new thought however when I thought about why I was panicing or distracted, I asked myself why and I said that I was feelinng worried that I was behind. Is there a way
to fix the root cause of the feeling? Or at least try to mitigate it?

I'm stressed  
Why
Cause I feel behind  
Why do you feel behind  
Cause I didn't do enough during the day  
Can you do anything about it right now?  
No.
What can you do right now?  
Foucs on my work

Maybe this is a good approach in the future. Ask yourself a few questions and come up with an action plan to mitigate the stress.

As I am struggling to stick with the CE type video I'm watching. I did notice that I didn't want to start it because I fear in being able to understand what it's about.
This lack of faith isn't new, however it still might be good to realize how I'm fighting against that. I should think of ways to combat that.
Journal? Describe fears? I know I should attack what I don't know, but it's never me. So many think of the worst time I had with something where I felt challenged? Like show that
I did't die. Or what was the worst variable? Was it that bad? What is it about not understanding and struggling that's so bad?

Just a note to say that this was successful. Also that when I got down to it, the work I was trying to do maybe took me 20-30 mins. So like no time at all. So have faith that what you're trying to do is helping. I almost had that feeling too when I started outlining notes for this. It was like "You know what to do and you know you can switch context and be successful."

This isn't going to make sense. But sometimes you're too hard on yourself and sometimes you're not pressing hard enough. This doesn't need to be as difficult as it is.

More and more you're recognizing that your state of mind is a HUGE factor. The more you can also think of that in all areas of your life the better.

I want to see if I can be more specific about my internal nav and what might be a positive stimulation / source for a higher reward. I thought that "coding" could be that.

Q - Why do I hate this? Why do I avoid?

- Too hard?
- If I'm challenged then I see my shortcomings?
- Is it just work is work and it's not fun.

Q - Where is the source for motivation for work? Anything else is really easy to identify.

- You would agree that work produces a higher reward

Feeling like I can't solve it. Frustrated. So my attitude sucks. So do something to change your attitude! Listening to "Never Be the Same" from CC. Try getting into a happy place.  
Yes I have the possibility of getting distracted by the music. But the point is to change your mood.

Didn't stick with INF but I am more into the work
