### Breakdown

Didn't stick with INF but I am more into the work

Feeling like I can't solve it. Frustrated. So my attitude sucks. So do something to change your attitude! Listening to "Never Be the Same" from CC. Try getting into a happy place.  
Yes I have the possibility of getting distracted by the music. But the point is to change your mood.

I want to see if I can be more specific about my internal nav and what might be a positive stimulation / source for a higher reward. I thought that "coding" could be that.

Q - Why do I hate this? Why do I avoid?

- Too hard?
- If I'm challenged then I see my shortcomings?
- Is it just work is work and it's not fun.

Q - Where is the source for motivation for work? Anything else is really easy to identify.

- You would agree that work produces a higher reward

This isn't going to make sense. But sometimes you're too hard on yourself and sometimes you're not pressing hard enough. This doesn't need to be as difficult as it is.

More and more you're recognizing that your state of mind is a HUGE factor. The more you can also think of that in all areas of your life the better.

Just a note to say that this was successful. Also that when I got down to it, the work I was trying to do maybe took me 20-30 mins. So like no time at all. So have faith that what you're trying to do is helping. I almost had that feeling too when I started outlining notes for this. It was like "You know what to do and you know you can switch context and be successful."
