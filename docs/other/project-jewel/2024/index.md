## Feeling my Feelings

<br>

**2024-10-21**  
Something holding me back. Maybe I should call it _resistance_. It's as if I know I won't understand something. I have to read and I will fight it. I'll have to start somewhere and I'll fight it. What doesn't make sense is that it seems to stem from the idea that I'm not smart enough and yet when I get cruising on somehing I feel a sort of cognitive freedom or cognitive flex that feels good. So why? Why in bloody hell why? I am my own worse enemy. I always stand in the way of me (Now I sound like Kamala Harris). I guess that's all I have right now. Still frustrated and disappointed in me. It could always simply be that I go with what is less difficult. The zero resistance path. Maybe it's like my relationship with running. I don't like it one bit. I dread it. Never look forward to it and when it's done I'm just glad it's over. But I never feel more confident from doing it.
