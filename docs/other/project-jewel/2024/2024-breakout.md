Afraid of looking like I don't know what I'm talking about. Though I'm highly opinionated over the topic. I feel this challenge to my intelligence. A challenge to my work which is effort that I've put in. I can get sick of not having a voice and getting passed over. 

Can I be open to new ideas even though they challenge yours? Can you think of it like not jumping to malice when something offends you? How can I do that? 

1. Get into a calm place - Listen to a song
1. Control breathing
1. Remember that idea of being on a higher ground so that you don't take things personally

Don't want to read a message on Teams. I feel challenged. I always hate it when everyone has to be right and I'm wrong. Lack of confidence, life beating me down. Being a younger brother. Being the youngest in the family. So many things have contributed to being defensive, not being confident, always feeling less than. I believe that others would find fire in it, get better, and somehow feel like they are now worthy. But no matter what I go through and accomplish - I never feel this or feel it for long

Approach: 

1. Read it through slowly and don't judge
1. Take a break
1. Read it through each section at a time and make notes
1. Place yourself on that higher ground

I don't want to read. Why? Too much work? Could be. Organizing my thoughts seem to take A LOT of effort. I'm talking like 1 to 2 pages at a time at a super slow pace. Read 2 lines and write a bunch. Maybe that's just what it takes to understand for me? Options:

1. Recognize that it's what it takes for me

1. Create a new approach to reading comprehension?
