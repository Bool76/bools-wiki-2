# Vitepress | Ignore Build Files

<br>

Currently this is just a note about how when I started Bool Wiki 2, I wasn't ignoring the build files as part of the Git tracked files. This has caused a series of headaches. I have since tried to ignore those files and directories. This is almost a test to see if this works or not.
