# SSH Keys

An SSH Key relies upon the use of two keys, a Public Key and a Private Key. Together create a key pair that is used as the secure access credential.

The Private Key is secret, known only to the user, and should be encrypted and stored safely

The Public Key can be shared freely with any SSH server to which the user wishes to connect

_Example_  
_If you want access to a Github repo you will need to share your Public SSH key with the repo to get access_
