| --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Affinity Estimation                                 |         |
| Top Down / Rolling Waving Planning                  |         |
| Bottom Up                                           |

| Relative Sizing / T-Shirt Sizes / Affinity Grouping |         |

#### Affinity Estimation

Stories are placed on post-its and placed on a board.  
Left -> Smaller Stories  
Right -> Larger Stories

#### T-Shirt Size / Relative Estimation

A granular sized Story is defined and every other Story is measured against it

#### Planning Poker / Fibonacci Numbers

Either playing cards represent numbers of varying degrees and the team votes  
OR  
Team votes w/ fibonacci numbers
