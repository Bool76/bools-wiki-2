## Agile Triangles

**Agile Iron Triangle** - Just like the basic Iron Triangle of Constraints, the Agile Iron Triangle also has the three points:

1. Scope
2. Cost
3. Schedule

But visually it's flipped upside down. Unlike the Iron Triangle, the Agile Iron Triangle's "schedule" point doesn't flex at all if other points move

<br>

**Agile Triangle of Constraints** - To better reflect the values of Agile this triangle was created. It consists of the following three points:

1. Quality (or Intrinsic Quality) - Represent the importance of internal process / continuous delivery
2. Value (or Extrinsic Quality) - Represents the value of the deliverables for the customer
3. Constraints - Represents all the original Iron Triangle points

## Agile Team Positions

### Product Owner

- Represents business / customer
- Understands business needs
- Understands customer / user needs
- Prioritizes backlog

  <br><br>

## Risk Management

Summary - Risks to an Agile project are reviewed before the start of each Sprint. Also teams can utilze a Risk Backlog to keep track of risks
