### Velocity

#### Sprint Velocity

Overview - Defining what your team's velocity is for a spint. Assessing team performance and NOT individual performance.

Details - Combine / Add the total number of Story Points that were actually COMPLETED in the Sprint. It doesn't matter if 100 point were committed to be completed, just what stories were ACTUALLY COMPLETED.

_Example_

<blockquote>
Team has committed to 7 User Stories for a sprint<br>  
Each user story = 8 points<br><br>

Team completed 4 User Stories<br>
What is the Sprint Velocity?<br>

ANS: 32 points (8\*4=32)

</blockquote>

<br>

#### Average Team Velocity

Overview - Defining what your team's velocity is overall (or for a project)

Details - Take at least the last three Sprint Velocities and find the average

> :warning: **Warning:** You want to have at least 3 sprints of Sprint Velocities. It take a bit to get a teams rythm

_Example_

<blockquote>
Last Three Sprints:<br>
Sprint 1: 24
Sprint 2: 32
Sprint 3: 40
 <br><br>  
Just find out the average:

(24+23+40) / 3 = 32<br><br>

ANS: 32 points Average Team Velocity (to base future sprints on)<br>

</blockquote>
