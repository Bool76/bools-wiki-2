<br>

#### What metric is used to control workload?

Work in Progress Limits (WIP)

#### How else are ticket measured?

Cycle Time

<br><br>

### Key Terms

| Term                          | Definition                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cycle Time                    | Total amount of elapsed time between when a task starts and when a task finishes                         |
| Lead Time                     | The amount of time that passes from the point a new work item is requested to the point it is completed. |
| Throughput                    | How progress is measured (like velocity for Scrum)                                                       |
| Work in Progress Limits (WIP) | How work load is controlled for developers                                                               |

### Metrics

#### Throughput

Overview - Defining what your Kanban team's performance is the idea of _Throughput_

> :memo: **Note:** This is different from Scrum usage of Velocity because Kanban doesn't have specifc timeboxed Iterations (Sprints).

Details - Total number of story points completed that have a beginning date and end date within a calendar month

_Example_

<blockquote>
tbd

</blockquote>

<span class="warning">QUESTION - What happens with tickets that start in the middle of a month and finish in a different month?</span>

<br><br>

#### Cycle Time

Overview - Total amount of elapsed time between when a task starts and when a task finishes

Calulation - Work in Progress / Throughput

_Example_
