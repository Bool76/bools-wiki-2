### Types of Quality

1. Control Quality - Testing of deliverables
2. Manage Quality - Testing of internal processes

<br><br>

### Types of Quality Cost

Summary - Cost of doing something right or wrong

### Tool Breakdown

#### Fishbone | Ishikawa Diagram

Both of these terms refer to the same concept for a Quality related tool. These help identify the "cause + effect" or root cause of something. Do you want to know where something came from? Use these tools.

#### Histogram

Type of bar chart. Displays the frequency (how much) you might see a certain data point

e.g.  
Theme: Height of cherry trees  
X-axis: shows a range of heights  
Y-axis shows number of trees in population
Overall: Bar chart will show how many trees reach different heights

#### Pareto Chart

Is a type of histogram (bar chart) used to rank causes of problems in hierarchical format. The goal is to narrow down primary causes of issues. Can help you get to the 80/20 rule / tool.
