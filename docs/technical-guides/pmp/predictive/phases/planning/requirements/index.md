### Document Breakdown

#### Project Scope Statement

What's included:

- Project description
- Major deliverables
- Assumptions
- Acceptance criteria / Definition of Done
- Exclusions / Constraints
- What's in Scope
- What's out of Scope

> :memo: **Note:** In Agile - through _progressive elaboration_ the Project Scope Statement can change some as the scope becomes clearer

> :memo: **Note:** In the Closing Phase - This document could be used to validate deliverables
