### What is Configuration Management?

The plan identifies items that you want more control over if / when / how they are changed and that they require a formal change control. Topics normally refers to items that have "baselines"

The plan can identify which project documents will need formal change control

Though... the change process that needs to be followed would be in the **Change Management Plan**

<br>

**Examples of Configuration Topics**

- Scope
- Schedule
- Cost / Budget

<br>

**Why again do you do this?**  
At a point in the project you might want to lock in place Scope or the Budget. Therefore making it a formal process to change those items.
