## Risk Identifcation Process

1. **COLLECT INPUTS**

Overview - First step is to identify risks to your project and there are a number of sources and tools to use to do that

- Risk Management Plan
- Project Management Plan
- Stakeholder Register
- Lessons Learned
- OPA
- EEF
- Industry Experts

By using all of these you'll come up with a list of risks that are entered into the **Risk Register**

<br>

2. **PRIORITIZING**

Overview - Now your job is to prioritize these risks and see how they measure up against each other. The main concept is that you must assess the **Impact and Probability** (Qualitative Analysis - Tool)
In order to do this you must assess the Impact and Probability (Qualitative Analysis - Tool)

Tools used:

- Qualitative Analysis
- Quantitative Analysis
- Expert Judgement
- Interviews
- Risk Workshop
- Monte Carlo Method
- Bubble Chart / Hierarchical

Other fields are filled out in the **Risk Register**:

- Description
- Impact / Probility
- Priortization Position
- Triggers
- Warning Signs
- Strategy / Response
- Residual risks
- Owner

<br>

3. **OUTPUT**

Overview - The result of this process is that many different documents will get updated. Some of them are:

- Risk Register
- Risk Report
- Assumptions Log
- Issue Log
- Lessons Learned

<br>

## Risk Concepts

#### High Level Types of Risks

Overview - You would think there is only a "negative" type of risk but there is also a positive risk

1. Positive Risk

1. Negative Risk

<br>

#### Other Types of Risks

**Secondary Risk** - Risk caused from a planned risk response that was enacted

_Example_

<blockquote>
Risk: Possibly failing a test<br>  
Planned Response: Stay up all night and study<br>
Secondary Risk: You might be too sleepy during the test
</blockquote>

<br>

**Residual Risk** - When a planned risk response won't alleviate all possible variables of the risk

_Example_

<blockquote>
Risk: Weather forecast looks like colder weather<br>  
Planned Response: You take a sweatshirt with you<br>
Residual Risk: The weather could get colder which mean the sweatshirt isn't good enough
</blockquote>

<br>

#### Strategies

**Negative Strategies**

1. Escalate
1. Avoid
1. Transfer
1. Mitigate
1. Accept

**Positive Strategies**

1. Escalate
1. Share
1. Exploit
1. Enhance
1. Accept

> :warning: **Warning:** An ACCEPTANCE response in the Risk Register will not have a specific reponse plan - use the "Fallback Plan"

<br><br>

## Documents Explained

#### Risk Register

**Process**

1. ID / Record risk
1. Assess risk impact / probability
1. Plan risk response

<br>

**What do you identify (or record)**

1. Description
1. Impact / Probility
1. Triggers
1. Warning Signs
1. Strategy / Response
1. Residual risks
1. Owner

<br><br>

## Tools Explained

#### Probability and Impact Matrix

Overview - Part of Qualitative analysis. It's a grid where you give a rating for both _impact_ and _probability_ of a risk and then either trace the numbers to one number on the matrix or you can also multiple both numbers. That number on the matrix's (grid) location corrosponds with like a severity level; which can help you decide to do something or not.

> :warning: **Warning:** The Probability and Impact Matrix is something you use and NOT update

Steps:

1. Record what the risk is in the **Risk Register**
1. Accoring to the possible IMPACT, using the ratings on the matrix, give it a rating reflecting what's the impact of the risk (e.g. 0.1 - 0.9)
1. Accoring to the possible PROBABILITY, using the ratings on the matrix, give it a rating reflecting what's the probability of the risk occuring (e.g. 0.1 - 0.9)
1. You can either:
   1. Multiple both numbers together and find that number on the matrix
   1. Trace both numbers to the number they match with
1. Based on the location of the number on the matrix, you'll have an overall rating so to help you make a decision

_Example_

<blockquote>
RISK: JQuery library utilized for a modal might unsupported<br/><br/>

What's the IMPACT rating you're giving it? ANS: .5<br/><br/>

What's the PROBABILITY rating you're giving it? ANS: .85<br/><br/>

Use the matrix to trace those two numbers to one number: 0.40<br/><br/>

If you look at the matrix (Google one) then the result is in the RED

</blockquote>

<br>

#### Bubble Chart

> :memo: **Note:** Bubble Chart is also a type of Hierarchical Chart

Summary - Bubble Chart can also be called a Hierarchy Bubble. You can show relationships by connecting bubbles and the size of the bubbles to show importance.

How do you use it?

<br>

#### Qualitative Risk Analysis

Summary - Basic risk analysis used to assess IMPACT and PROBABILITY. Just remember those two variables.

Example Qualitative Tool: Impact and Probability Matrix

<br>

#### Quantitative Risk Analysis

Summary - Involved and detailed analysis using specific data or numbers. Can be used to look at financials.

Example Quantitative Tool: Monte-Carlo
