### Types of Changes

**Corrective Action** - It's about not being in compliance w/ requirements or scope; therefore a corrective action must be taken.  
_e.g. The deliverable doesn't meet two of the requirements_

<br>

**Defect Repart** - When functionality is broken or not working as expected  
_e.g. Product performance has been greatly reduced and needs fixing_

<br>

**Preventitve Action** - Actions that are taken to prevent issues. A possible issue is forcasted and proactive changes are made.  
_e.g. Customer would like better training documents so that they can better understand how to use the product_

<br>

**Updates** - Basic changes that don't involve scope or defects  
_e.g. Change Log gets updated when a change is approved_
