### High Level Process of Engaging Stakeholders

1. Document any identified Stakeholder in the **Stakeholder Register**
2. Assess the level of engagement for each stakeholder using the **Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix**
3. If a stakeholder isn't at the engagement level desired -- Enter stakeholder into the **Stakeholder Engagement Plan** and come up with a strategy to get them at desired level

> :warning: **Warning:** I don't know if you might enter every stakeholder in the Stakeholder Engagement Plan to document a strategy that is currently working for that stakeholder

> :warning: **Warning** I don't know if there's a time where a level of communication is added to the Communication Management Plan
