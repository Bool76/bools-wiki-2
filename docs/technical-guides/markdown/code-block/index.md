# Markdown | Code Block

Overview - You know how to use code blocks but you always forget about the ability the identify the type of code you're writing in within the code block

#### Identify Type of Code

At the beginning of the code block simply place the type of code you're writing in

```javascript
const testVariable = "Some String";
```

_Breakdown_

- The type of code you're writing is Javascript
- You place `javascript` after the 3 tick marks
- Two things will then happen:
  - When looking at the actual block of code it will format it as Javascript code
  - On the web page it will also format the code as Javascript code
