## Random Notes

1. IMPORTANT - You're not going to start debugging in VS by clicking the "Start" button. You have to run it a different way

1. How to run it:
    1. Debug
    1. Reattach to w3wp.exe
    1. You might get a warning window that reads: Do you want to attach this process?
    1. Click: Attach

1. How to step through
    1. Of course you need to be running debug (see above on how to do that)
    1. Use the: Step Into, Step Over, and Step Out debug options. Icons are at the top menu bar (right now I can't take a screenshot because VS sucks)
