# Vue | Variables

Overview - You can think that there are many different types of keywords when declaring variables. Here is an overview of them.


### Const

Summary: Variables defined w/ `const` cannot be reassigned a new value. A reference to their value is read only.  

Scope: Block - It's only available within it's block of code (everything w/ in curly brackets)


*Example*
```
const name = "John Cocktosten";
```

### Let

Summary: If you want to update a variable value or you know that it will change the use `let`. In other words it is NOT read only like `const` is.  

Scope: Block - It's value is only available within it's block of code (everything w/ in curly brackets)
