# Dev Tools | Move Style Window

Summary - How do you move the Styles section in Chrome Dev Tools below the Elements section or horizontal vs vertical to it?

### Problem  
When Chrome Dev Tools is open, the styles tab / window is to the right of the elements window. With this configuration you don't have a lot of room to work. See screenshot:

### Solution

1. With Dev Tools open find the settings icon (gear) and click on it
2. You should be in the Preferences window - Locate the "Panel layout" section
