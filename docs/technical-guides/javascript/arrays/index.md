# Javascript | Arrays [draft]

An array is a list of values

With an array you don't need to know how many items or values are in it

The values in the array don't need to be the same data type

#### Creating an Array

1. Using Square Brackets

_Example_

```
const colors;
colors = ['white', 'red', 'black'];
```

2. Using keyword "New" and Array()

_Example_

```javascript
const colors = new Array("white", "red", "black");
```

<br>

Each item in an Array has a number associated to it called either an index or a key

The first items index in an array starts with "0" and then goes on to "1, 2, 3..."

<br>

#### Accessing Array Values and setting to a variable

```javascript
const singers = ["Bob", "Georgie", "Mike"];

const firstSinger = singers[0];
```
