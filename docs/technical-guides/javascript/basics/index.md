# Javascript | Basics

Overview - Breaking down some basic important concepts to remember about Javascript

### Curly Brackets - { }

#### With a Variable

When you see these know that you're seeing an object

#### With a Function

Everything within the curly brackets w/ a function is part of the function and will fire off

<br><br>

### Square Brackets - [ ]

#### With a Variable

When you see these know that you're seeing an array or a list

<br><br>

### .Value

Quite often you'll see a `.value` notation regarding a variable. This is called a **property accessor**. What this means is that it allows you to gain access to an objects properties.

Another important concept here is the dot notation and it's relationship to a variable or an object. Maybe think of it like the standard notation of accessing an oject.

First you must identify the thing or variable you want to work with and then use the **property accessor** to indicate that you want to dive deeper into that object.

_Example_

```
bikes.value = results
```

<br><br>

### "Return" and it's relationship w/ Function

More times than not you'll need a `return` declaration at the end of a function so that you're returning some sort of value. Otherwise it's quite possible that a function does a bunch of stuff but then doesn't give you anything and that's what you're missing.

### Keys

An object will have properties define what it is.

_Example_
If you had an object called "Car" then some of it's properties could be:

- Transmission
- Engine
- Doors
- Color

An object's properties can also be called **Keys**
