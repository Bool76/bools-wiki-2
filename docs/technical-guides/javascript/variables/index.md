# Javascript | Variables [draft]

Looks like multiple vars can be declared and set on the same line:

- You use a comma to separate them
- You only have to use the `var` keyword once

_Example_

```javascript
var price = 5,
  cost = 6;
```

<br>

Variables can also hold a reference to an html element

_Example_

```javascript
var asdf = document.getElementById("cost");
```

<br>

REMEMBER ABOUT VARIABLES:

1. A custom variable name CANNOT have: Dashes
1. A custom variable name CANNOT have: Start with a number
1. Case sensitive
