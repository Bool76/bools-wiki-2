# DOM

Overview - The DOM or Document Object Model is the way Javascript approaches and interacts with a web page. A browser's interpreter "reads" through a page and creates a model of that page which is a hierarchy of objects. The DOM Tree is made up of nodes. There are 4 types of nodes. See those below.

## Node Types

#### Document Node

#### Element Node

#### Attribute Node

#### Text Node

More Detail - The browser's interpreter understands a web page by breaking it into a tree type structure, which is a hierarchy of page objects.
