#### Arithmetic Operators

Operators that you can use with numbers

NOTE: You can set a math based expression to a variable and then create a math expression between 2 variables

```javascript
const firstNumber = (14 + 2) * 5;
const secondNumber = 3 * 4 * 5;
const total = firstNumber + secondNumber;
```

#### String Operator

There's only one and that's the `+` symbol that concatenates strings together

```javascript
const fname = "Bob";
const lname = "Cobb";
const fullName = fname + " " + lname;
```
